# Calendar Viewer

Calendar Viewer is a frontend challenge from [FrontendPro](https://www.frontendpro.dev/frontend-coding-challenges/calendar-viewer-component-KnvtY1kLkwCisNB2LTsG), an interesting website provides many modern common components.

This challenge is mostly to handle day related calculation, including getDate, getDay (week), getYear, get total days in specific month, and I choose `date-fns` for easy manipulation.
